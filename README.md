# german-placenames
An interactive map project for German placenames

This is a project to create an interactive map featuring the distribution of place name endings in Germany. 
The placenames are on the Ort level, the smallest populated place designation in Germany. Statistics are calculated on the Regierungsbezirk level. There are 13,108 Orte in the dataset used.

(the order of administrative divisions is roughly as follows: Ort, Gemeinde, Kreis, Regionsbezirk, Bundesland. [Relevant diagram from Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Administrative_divisions_of_Germany.svg)) 

Future version in which all types of administrative divisions are considered placenames, as well as common place name beginnings. (e.g. “Bad “, “Ober-“, etc.). 
Other countries may be added in the future.

# Purpose
The original intent of this project was to improve my score in [Geoguessr](https://geoguessr.com/), a Google Street View-based discovery game.

# Credits
- This project was modeled after Colin Eberhardt's [similar project involving UK and Ireland placenames](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/06/25/uk-place-names.html)
- The geojson file of German Regierungsbezirke can be found [here](https://github.com/isellsoap/deutschlandGeoJSON).
